I am a robotics engineer specializing in motion planning, control, and intelligent automation. My work focuses on developing algorithms and systems that enable robots to operate reliably in complex, dynamic environments. From trajectory optimization and reinforcement learning to computer vision and generative AI, I combine advanced methods with practical engineering to create robots that can perform sophisticated tasks with precision.

I have designed and implemented planning frameworks for robot arms, including bimanual manipulation setups, where robots must coordinate in real time to handle delicate or constrained tasks. My projects span areas such as medical robotics, autonomous grasping, and learning-based trajectory generation, all of which emphasize safe, efficient, and adaptive robot behavior.

With a strong technical foundation in Python, C++, ROS, and MATLAB, I build end-to-end robotic systemsâ€”from algorithm design to simulation and hardware integration. I enjoy working on projects where I can bring together control theory, machine learning, and embedded design to create robots that move from research prototypes into real-world applications.
