I am a robotics engineer specializing in motion planning, control, and intelligent automation. Over my MSc, I have worked on the following:

1- Explored Optimization-based Motion Planning through [Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04422). For one side project in my MSc, I used GCS to plan trajectories for automating shoe lacing usinng a bimanual robot arm setup.
2- Developed an sampling-based motion planning algorithm that aims to minimize re-planning in dynamic environments
3- Used Diffusion Policy to train a policy for medical suturing for a bimanual robot arm setup.
4- Finetuned [OpenVLA](https://openvla.github.io/) to develop language-conditioned policy for blood suctioning.

I have done some projects concerning reinforcement learning, optimal control, and as well previously embedded systems and power electronics.

Outside of my professional career, I enjoy chess, reading history, and lifting weights.
