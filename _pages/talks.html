### Project I: Exploring Nonlinear Model Predictive Control in Two-Link Robot Arm Motion Planning

[Final Report](https://amrmarey15.github.io/files/MPC_RobotArm.pdf)

- Explores nonlinear MPC for motion planning in a two-link robot arm.
- **Two strategies tested:**
  - Long prediction horizon → better accuracy, higher computation
  - Terminal state constraints → shorter horizon, lower computation, but feasibility issues.
- Both methods achieved the target (some failure cases discussed) while respecting constraints.
- Results highlight trade-offs between performance vs. computational cost.
- **Future work:** real robot testing, adaptive horizons, moving obstacles, robustness to non-ideal dynamics.

### Project II: PPO with Compressed RGB Inputs for Robotic Grasping

[Final Report](https://amrmarey15.github.io/files/PPO.pdf)

- Tests VAEs and β-VAEs as state compression for PPO in a simulated Kuka grasping task.
- Dataset of 111k RGB images; autoencoders trained with latent dims 1–1000 and β ∈ {0.1, 1, 10}; PPO uses latent vectors instead of 48×48×3 images.
- **Results:** best at latent dim = 10, β = 0.1 (mean reward 0.54 vs 0.42 baseline); small latents stable; large latents struggled with high β.
- **Conclusion:** Latent compression can improve PPO efficiency, with trade-offs between representation size, β regularization, and convergence stability.
