Project I: Exploring Nonlinear Model Predictive Control in Two-Link Robot Arm Motion Planning

<a href="https://amrmarey15.github.io/files/MPC_RobotArm.pdf" style="font-size: 16px;">Final Report</a>


* Explores nonlinear MPC for motion planning in a two-link robot arm.

* Two strategies tested:
    a - Long prediction horizon → better accuracy, higher computation
    b - Terminal state constraints → shorter horizon, lower computation, but feasibility issues.

* Both methods achieved the target (some failure cases discussed) while respecting constraints.

* Results highlight trade-offs between performance vs. computational cost.
* **Future work:** real robot testing, adaptive horizons, moving obstacles, robustness to non-ideal dynamics.
