### Project I: Exploring Nonlinear Model Predictive Control in Two-Link Robot Arm Motion Planning

[Final Report](https://amrmarey15.github.io/files/MPC_RobotArm.pdf)

* Explores nonlinear MPC for motion planning in a two-link robot arm.

* Two strategies tested:
    a - Long prediction horizon → better accuracy, higher computation
    b - Terminal state constraints → shorter horizon, lower computation, but feasibility issues.

* Both methods achieved the target (some failure cases discussed) while respecting constraints.

* Results highlight trade-offs between performance vs. computational cost.
* **Future work:** real robot testing, adaptive horizons, moving obstacles, robustness to non-ideal dynamics.

### Project II: PPO with Compressed RGB Inputs for Robotic Grasping Problem

[Final Report](https://amrmarey15.github.io/files/PPO.pdf)

* The paper tests VAEs and β-VAEs as state compression methods for PPO in a simulated Kuka robotic grasping task.

* A dataset of 111k RGB images was collected; multiple auto-encoders with varying latent dimensions (1–1000) and β values (0.1, 1, 10) were trained. PPO agents then learned policies using these compressed latent vectors instead of raw 48×48×3 images.

* Results: Best performance at latent dim = 10, β = 0.1, improving mean reward from 0.42 (baseline) to 0.54; small latent spaces were stable, while large ones suffered with high β.

* Conclusion: Latent compression can improve PPO efficiency, though trade-offs exist between representation size, β regularization, and convergence stability.
