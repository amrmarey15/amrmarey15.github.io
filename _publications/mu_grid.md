<strong>Abstract</strong>

This paper suggests a new high voltage gain DC-DC power electronics boosting converter. Many recent applications demand that an input voltage source is boosted to provide a much larger output voltage to be used elsewhere. The modern photovoltaic/fuel-cell sources or battery to mu-grid (μ- grid) structure heavily depends on the voltage boosting concept since these sources generate a voltage of a small magnitude. In this structure, high voltage boosting DC-DC converters are necessary to integrate renewables into the DC μ-grid structure. The newly proposed converter, referred to in this paper as the Switched-Capacitor-Inductor-Boosting (SCIB) Converter, allows for an efficient voltage boosting operation suitable for various applications such as the photovoltaic, μ-grid structure, portable embedded systems, etc. The SCIB converter topology is based on the SEPIC and a switched-capacitor-inductor structure. Although the classical SEPIC converter is admired by industry due to its ability to provide a non-inverted output voltage that is stepped down or stepped up from the input voltage, the boosting gain of the SEPIC is limited; hence, the proposed converter is designed to boost the voltage gain further. The mathematical analysis and discussion on the voltage gain and switch stress of the SCIB converter are shown and validated through numerical software.
