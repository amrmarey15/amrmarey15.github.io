<strong>Abstract</strong>

In the photovoltaic (PV) to grid structure, DC-DC converters are essential to increase the low input voltage gener-ated by renewable energy sources. The Single Ended Primary Inductance DC-DC Converter (SEPIC) allows for an output voltage higher or lower than that of the input. However, the gain of the SEPIC converter is limited; this converter can generate only a voltage gain of 5 at an 83.33 % duty cycle. Consequently, a conventional SEPIC structure is not a practical solution for achieving high output voltage from renewable energy sources. Furthermore, switched inductors are already adopted in several voltages, boosting converters. In this paper, a unique boosting DC- DC converter is derived by integrating the modified Switched Inductor (SI) converter networks and the SEPIC structure. The proposed converter is the SESIC (Single Ended Switched Inductor Converter). The discussion on the proposed converter regarding voltage ratio and voltage stress across switches is articulated. The topology of the proposed circuit is simple, has a reduced voltage across the switch, has high efficiency and is suitable for high voltage boosting applications. The performance of the proposed converter is validated through simulation work.
