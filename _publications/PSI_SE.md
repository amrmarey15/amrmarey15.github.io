<strong>Abstract</strong>

The emergence of environmental-friendly electric vehicles (E-Vehicles) presents a need for high-static gain DC-DC converters. One of the more popular DC-DC converters is the Single-Ended Primary-Inductance Converter (SEPIC), often used in applications where DC-DC conversion is needed; this is because the SEPIC allows for either step-up or step-down conversion. However, the SEPIC is usually not a practical solution for high-voltage applications due to the limited voltage gain. This paper presents a new DC-DC converter named the Primary-Switched-Inductance Single-Ended Converter (PSI-SE Converter) suitable for low to high-voltage boosting applications. The topology of this converter is mainly derived from the SEPIC topology alongside some minor modifications in the switched-inductor network, where the two outer diodes in the switched-inductor structure are replaced with capacitors. The operation of the PSI-SE converter is discussed thoroughly with mathematical analysis and compared to other similar converters. The simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the converter. The proposed topology is the solution for low to high-voltage boosting in E-Vehicles applications.
